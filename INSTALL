This are the installation instructions for xd under Linux. Xd can also be used
in the CYGWIN environment, see below for details.

Quick Installation instruction:
===============================

1. Do as root in the directory where xd unpacked to:

        install xd /usr/local/bin
        
to install the provided version of xd in /usr/local/bin

2. Add the following alias to your csh.cshrc (or whatever file you use as
your system-wide alias file):
   
        alias   xd  'cd `/usr/local/bin/xd \!*`'


Extensive Installation Instruction:
===================================

Preliminaries:
--------------

You need icmake to compile xd yourself. Icmake may be obtained from
ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix

If you don't have icmake, you have to compile and link all sources by hand.
Limited support for this case is provided here.

Installation Instructions:
--------------------------

1. All instructions should be done from the directory where
   the xd.X.YY.tgz archive unpacked to (i.e., xd/).
2. (Obsolete)
3. If preferred, edit the name of the configurationfile to be used.
   to do this, edit in configure.h, the #define XD_CONFIG_PATH.
   It is always relative to $HOME, and in the distribution it is set
   to "/.conf/xd/xd.conf".
4. Do (not necessarily as root)
    ./build
    Note that not all OSs use the -m486 compiler flag. Remove it from the 
    `build' script if not applicable.
    This creates in the current directory libxd.a and xd.
    During the compilation, two warnings are generated.
    They can safely be ignored.
5. Do (as root)
    install xd /usr/local/bin
6. Add the following alias to your csh.cshrc (or whatever file you use as
   your system-wide alias file):
   
    alias   xd      'cd `/usr/local/bin/xd \!*`'

    When using bash, define

    xd()
    {
        cd `/usr/local/bin/xd $*`
    }

    in your .profile

XD on cygwin
------------

    If you want to use XD in the CYGWIN environment, uncomment 

        // #define CYGWIN

    in `build`. Compilation produces xd.exe, which may be installed in 
    Cygwin's /usr/local/bin area.

    If you don't want to use icmake (although it compiles out of the box
    in the Cygwin environment) you can compile xd `by hand':

    g++ -o xd.exe *.cc */*.cc -s

Cleanup-instructions.
---------------------

Some simple cleanup may be required. The compilation left libxd.a and xd.
All other intermediate compilation products were removed by build.

If required, libxd.a and xd can be removed.
